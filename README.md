## What Interests Me About The Article

This article looks at the future for developers and how the way we write code might shift in the future. The author, Owen Hughes, mentions that automatic code generators (ACGs), such as Github CoPilot, AWS CodeWhisperer, and Tab9 can potentially improve developers' efficiencies. These tools can autofill certain portions of code for devleopers so they can pay more attention to the core program. Owen also mentions that low-code or no-code developer tools will likely become mainstream in the future. Although this can be limiting in terms of the quality and functionality of the resulting program, this trend surely allows more people to join the developmental force. In Owen's words, this can "further democratize tech jobs". 

This idea is particularly interesting to me since I have read lots of articles regarding the future of technology--the future of the internet, the future of automobiles, etc. However, few articles mention the future of developers, who are the ones making all technological progresses become realizations. I, pesonally, never thought of what the future developing environment would look like either. This article hence presented to me a new point of view, a new perspective of the future.

Wonderful Article!! Loved reading it! - Dev Kalavadiya

Github CoPilot is crazy! I've use one of the AI code assistant in JetBrain called Tabnine. Though it generates some weird names sometimes, it still boost up the speed in coding especially when you are writing a large project with thousands of variables. GitHub CoPilot is totally on the next level (and expensive :( ). It can save lots of trivial work and avoid typos. I often think the past courses I've taken, and how it would be different if we introduce GitHub CoPilot instead of some rudimentary text editors or IDEs like SubLime or Eclipse. I think with such AI code assistant tools, more and more people who never know CS before can gain interest in CS. - Ashley Luo
